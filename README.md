# Plagiarism Detection System

## Overview

This project is a plagiarism detection system that uses three classic string matching algorithms—**Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)**, **Boyer-Moore**, and **Rabin-Karp**—to detect similarities between texts. It includes preprocessing techniques to improve detection accuracy and an efficiency matrix to compare algorithm performance.

The application is built using **Streamlit** for a user-friendly web interface, allowing users to input text and patterns to check for plagiarism.

## Features

- **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming.
- **Plagiarism Detection**: Using KMP, Boyer-Moore, and Rabin-Karp algorithms.
- **Efficiency Matrix**: Measures and compares the time taken by each algorithm.
- **Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
